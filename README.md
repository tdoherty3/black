# The Fatal Lozenge, By Edward Gorey

An Apparition of her lover She recognizes with dismay;
and later on she will discover that he himself had died today.

The Baby, lying meek and quiet Upon the customary rug, Has dreams about rampage and riot, And will grow up to be a thug.


The Cad decides he has grown weary Of this affair, and that is that;
And so he tells her just dreary He thinks she is, then leaves the flat.

The Drudge expends her life in mopping, In emptying and filling pails;
And she will do so, never stopping, Until her strength entirely fails.

The Effigy, got up with clothing Abstracted from the victim's room,
Is raised aloft to cheers of loathing Before it meets a flaming doom.

The Fetishist gets out the hassock, Turns down the lamp, and blots the door;
Then in galoshes and a cassock, He worshipss It upon the floor.

The Invalid wakes up in terror To feel his toes becoming numb;
The doctor's made another error- What unkown symptoms are to come?

The Keeper, when itâ€™s time for luncheon,
Flings down his charge upon the bed,
And taking out a home-made truncheon,
Belabors him about the head.

The Lazar, blessed with an appearance
Enough to give the strongest qualms.
Has little need of perseverance
In prompting a display of alms.

The Nun is fearfully bedevilled:
She runs about and moans and shrieks;
Her flesh is bruised, her clothes dishevelled:
She's been like this for weeks and weeks.

The Orphan whom there's none to cherish
Strays through the gloom on naked feet;
She presently will fall, and perish
Unnoticed in some squalid street.

The Proctor buys a pupil ices, And hopes the boy will not resist
When he attempts to practise vices Few people even know exist.


The sight of the Uncle gives no pleasure,
But rather cases much alarm:
The children know that at his leisure
He plans to have them to have them come to harm.

The sight of the Uncle gives no pleasure,
But rather cases much alarm:
The children know that at his leisure
He plans to have them to have them come to harm.

The Yegg on rubber soles comes creeping
Inside the house when it is late,
And while the occupants are sleeping,
Remuve the heirlooms and the plate

The Zouave used to war and battle
Would sooner take a life than not:
It scarecly has begun to prattle
When he impales to hapless tot.
